Here, the name of this challenge is also a hint of it.

So, the source code is really clearly that it set real effective set userId and groupId for calling the vulnerable CVE-2014-6271 bash.

The sample payload of this vulnerability is: 
```
env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
```

```() { :;}``` means setting /bin/true to environment and return true then finish.

However, if this shell are in vulnerable version, it will execute the code between ```env x='() { :;};``` and ```' bash -c "echo this is a test"```.

Like this sample, it will print out `vulnerable` to shell, if the shell is vulnerable.

You can see that the shell given by challenge isn't vulnerable but `./shellshock` is.

All the code in `shellshock` all lead to return a vulnerable shell by changing `real effective set userID` and `groupID`.

So, we can simply `/bin/cat flag` to make it print out the falg.
